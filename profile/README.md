The D-REC Organization, evolved from the successful D-REC Initiative, stands at the forefront of accelerating the adoption of Distributed Renewable Energy (DRE) in the Global South. Our mission is to mobilize $100 million in global climate finance by 2030, focusing on catalyzing investments in small-scale DRE projects that are critical for a clean, just, and equitable energy transition.

To achieve this, DRE Certificates (D-RECs) equivalent to ~3,500 GWh will be issued, uplifting around 3.5 million lives to the Modern Energy Minimum standard and potentially enhancing the quality of life for up to 350 million people.

### What we do

Our core mechanism, the Distributed Renewable Energy Certificate (D-REC), is an innovative market instrument designed to issue Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs) from small-scale DRE resources. These D-RECs represent a tangible commitment not only to environmental sustainability but also to energy access with a correlation to socio-economic upliftment in underserved communities.

### Our impact

The D-REC Organization is more than just a facilitator of RECs. Through D-RECs, we deepen the corporate climate action to enable small-scale DRE projects to become economically viable and environmentally impactful. Our work not only contributes to meeting global sustainability targets but also ensures that the benefits of renewable energy reach those who need it most.

### Our approach

Leveraging technology and innovation, we have built a robust platform that streamlines the aggregation and verification process of DRE projects, enabling their certification by relevant bodies. 

### Collaboration and partnerships

We believe in the power of partnerships. Collaborating with energy sector stakeholders, governments, NGOs, corporations, and financial institutions, we aim to create a cohesive ecosystem that  accelerates the adoption of DRE, mobilizes resources and achieves a broader impact.
